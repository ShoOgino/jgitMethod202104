	/**
	 * Mark an object or commit to start graph traversal from.
	 * <p>
	 * Callers are encouraged to use
	 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk#parseAny(AnyObjectId)} instead of
	 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)}, as
	 * this method requires the object to be parsed before it can be added as a
	 * root for the traversal.
	 * <p>
	 * The method will automatically parse an unparsed object, but error
	 * handling may be more difficult for the application to explain why a
	 * RevObject is not actually valid. The object pool of this walker would
	 * also be 'poisoned' by the invalid RevObject.
	 * <p>
	 * This method will automatically call
	 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk#markStart(RevCommit)} if passed
	 * RevCommit instance, or a RevTag that directly (or indirectly) references
	 * a RevCommit.
	 *
	 * @param o
	 *            the object to start traversing from. The object passed must be
	 *            from this same revision walker.
	 * @throws org.eclipse.jgit.errors.MissingObjectException
	 *             the object supplied is not available from the object
	 *             database. This usually indicates the supplied object is
	 *             invalid, but the reference was constructed during an earlier
	 *             invocation to
	 *             {@link org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)}.
	 * @throws org.eclipse.jgit.errors.IncorrectObjectTypeException
	 *             the object was not parsed yet and it was discovered during
	 *             parsing that it is not actually the type of the instance
	 *             passed in. This usually indicates the caller used the wrong
	 *             type in a
	 *             {@link org.eclipse.jgit.revwalk.RevWalk#lookupAny(AnyObjectId, int)}
	 *             call.
	 * @throws java.io.IOException
	 *             a pack file or loose object could not be read.
