	/**
	 * Fetch objects and refs from the remote repository to the local one.
	 * <p>
	 * This is a utility function providing standard fetch behavior. Local
	 * tracking refs associated with the remote repository are automatically
	 * updated if this transport was created from a
	 * {@link org.eclipse.jgit.transport.RemoteConfig} with fetch RefSpecs
	 * defined.
	 *
	 * @param monitor
	 *            progress monitor to inform the user about our processing
	 *            activity. Must not be null. Use
	 *            {@link org.eclipse.jgit.lib.NullProgressMonitor} if progress
	 *            updates are not interesting or necessary.
	 * @param toFetch
	 *            specification of refs to fetch locally. May be null or the
	 *            empty collection to use the specifications from the
	 *            RemoteConfig. Source for each RefSpec can't be null.
	 * @return information describing the tracking refs updated.
	 * @throws org.eclipse.jgit.errors.NotSupportedException
	 *             this transport implementation does not support fetching
	 *             objects.
	 * @throws org.eclipse.jgit.errors.TransportException
	 *             the remote connection could not be established or object
	 *             copying (if necessary) failed or update specification was
	 *             incorrect.
